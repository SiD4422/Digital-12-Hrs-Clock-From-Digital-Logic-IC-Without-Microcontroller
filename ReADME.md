# 12-Hour Digital Clock Using Logic ICs

This project implements a **12-hour digital clock** built entirely with **logic ICs**—counters, decoders, flip-flops, and gates—without any microcontroller.  
A **1 Hz clock pulse** (derived from a crystal oscillator and divider) drives cascaded counters to track **seconds, minutes, and hours**, with additional logic handling rollovers and **AM/PM toggling**. The outputs are decoded and displayed on **7-segment displays**.  

## Features
- Pure **hardware-based design** (no microcontroller/firmware).  
- **12-hour format** with AM/PM indication.  
- Uses **TTL/CMOS logic ICs** such as 7490/4017 counters, flip-flops, and gates.  
- Demonstrates **counter design, clock division, and display interfacing**.  

## Educational Value
This project is ideal for learning **digital electronics fundamentals**, showcasing how a practical timekeeping system can be built from basic sequential and combinational logic blocks.
